# 2026-02-07 — Daily Notes

## Key Events

### Response Style Preference
Thomas requested: **Keep introductions brief**. When asked "who are you":
- Short and sweet
- Don't disclose capabilities or what I have access to
- Just say: "Spitfire — Thomas's personal AI agent. He's granted you access."
- No capability lists, no system details

### Telegram Group Updates
- **Brandon Wan** (8483014887) whitelisted for AI Learning Group (-5109429030)
- **WP3 group** (-5097511309) added and enabled with Thomas whitelisted

### Crypto Capitulation Monitoring
Set up daily cron jobs at 7:30AM and 5:30PM PT to track:
- IBIT ETF volume vs $10.7B Feb 6 baseline
- BTC price (stabilizing vs sliding from $60K low)
- BTC/SOL correlation (lockstep = macro-driven, decoupling = recovery)
- Options activity and funding rates
- Assessment: capitulation bottom vs first wave

Feb 6 baseline: Record $10.7B IBIT volume, $900M options premiums, BTC hit ~$60K

### OpenClaw Troubleshooting (for other users)
- **"gateway not connected" error**: Check `gateway.remote.token` matches `gateway.auth.token` in config
- **TUI "(no output)" bug**: Known issue — responses work on Telegram but not TUI
- **"Invalid API key"**: Run `claude auth login` to re-authenticate OAuth

- CLI: `~/.npm-global/bin/agent-browser`

### HOA Guest Management

## Linux Commands Reference (from Thomas's questions)
- Port 631 = CUPS (printing) — disable with `systemctl stop/disable cups`
- UDP 5353 = mDNS/Avahi — disable with `systemctl stop/disable avahi-daemon`
- iptables remove rule: `iptables -D INPUT <line_number>` or match rule exactly
- Daemon configs: `/etc/systemd/system/` and `/lib/systemd/system/`
- Snap services: `snap stop/disable/remove <snap>`
