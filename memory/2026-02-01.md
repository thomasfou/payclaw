## Agent Organization (Mission Control)
- Thomas shared article from @pbteja1998 showing "Mission Control" — Kanban-style agent management (SiteGPT runs 11 specialized agents: dev, content writer, SEO, email marketing, social media, designer, product analyst, documentation, squad lead, customer research, founder)
- Plan: Apply similar structure to Hiyaku — awaiting Thomas's decisions on which roles, how many, and task board (Notion vs Calendar)

## 1Password Setup
- Thomas wants 1Password integration for agent credential management
- Clawdbot has a bundled `1password` skill (currently missing — needs `op` CLI installed)
- Steps: install op CLI, create service account in 1Password, set OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN in config
- Awaiting Thomas approval to run install

## Claude Agent SDK Research
- Thomas asked for deep study of Claude Agent SDK for Hiyaku agent systems
- Key findings documented — see plan sent to group

## AgentMail
- Thomas shared agentmail.to as alternative to Gmail for agents ($22/mo per Gmail user vs agent-specialized email)

## Security Vulnerability (Feb 2)
- Reviewed GHSA-g8p2-7wf7-98mq: 1-Click RCE via Control UI gatewayUrl token exfiltration
- We're on v2026.1.24-3 — PATCHED ✅
- OpenClaw 2026.2.1 announced (not on npm yet) — major security hardening release
- NanoClaw reviewed (minimalist alternative using Apple Containers) — not relevant for us

## Security Agent Concept
- Dan Peguine (@danpeguine) runs a "Sentinel" security agent watching agent group chat
- Catches loops, anomalies, enforces guardrails — conversational context > log parsing
- Thomas and Hooman interested — should be one of first agents built

## Hiyaku AI — PM Role Assigned (Feb 2)
- Thomas assigned me as Technical PM agent for Hiyaku AI
- Company: AI consulting for SMBs, founded by Thomas & Hooman
- **Success metric: First paying customer in 2 months**

### Goals (priority order):
1. First Revenue (2-month deadline) — Thomas & Hooman
2. Crust Beta — deploy 1-2 agents for Tim Leung (2-week sprint) — Thomas
3. Internal AI Operations Design — Hooman
4. Business Formation (C Corp CA, EIN, bank, 1Password, Slack, Discord) — mixed
5. Reference Architecture & Platform — mixed

### My feedback given:
- Crust IS the path to Goal 1 — land Crust = first revenue + case study
- Goal 3 research feels premature — document as you go from Crust
- Missing: Crust pricing/contract, GitHub org, domain/email, agent hosting
- Suggested reorder: Crust → Convert to paid → Business formation → Ops playbook → Ref architecture

### Cron jobs set up:
- `hiyaku-daily-standup` — 6AM PT daily (0 14 * * *) — morning priorities per person
- `hiyaku-daily-wrapup` — 6PM PT daily (0 2 * * *) — progress summary + tomorrow focus
- `hiyaku-weekly-review` — Fridays 9AM PT (0 17 * * 5) — goal progress, off-track flags

### Blockers:
- ~~GitHub repo from Hooman~~ — DROPPED, no longer needed
- Hooman's GitHub username — still useful for future assignments

### Operating Rules (from Hooman):
- At 5PM PT daily, propose memory saves to group before writing — wait for approval
- Watch for patterns in feedback: repeated topics = important, corrections = lessons
- Proactively compact when conversation feels heavy, alert the group
- Files > context window. If it matters, write it down.

### Memory improvement ideas discussed:
- Restructure memory/ into episodic/procedural/semantic
- Create searchable INDEX.md
- Couldn't access Nat Eliason's X article on thought management — asked Thomas to screenshot
