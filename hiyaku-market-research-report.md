---

## 1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Industry Verticals (Prioritized by Readiness)

| Vertical | Why They Need AI Agents | Urgency |
|---|---|---|
| **Legal (small/mid firms)** | Document review, contract analysis, intake automation, billing. Drowning in repetitive knowledge work. | 🔴 High |
| **Healthcare (clinics, practices, dental)** | Patient scheduling, intake forms, insurance verification, follow-up. HIPAA compliance is a blocker they can't solve alone. | 🔴 High |
| **Real Estate (brokerages, property mgmt)** | Lead qualification, showing scheduling, tenant communications, document generation. High volume, low-margin tasks. | 🟡 Medium-High |
| **Financial Services (advisory, accounting)** | Client onboarding, compliance reporting, document processing, portfolio summaries. | 🟡 Medium-High |
| **E-commerce (DTC brands, Shopify stores)** | Customer support, returns processing, inventory alerts, personalized marketing. | 🟡 Medium |
| **Professional Services (consulting, marketing agencies)** | Proposal generation, project management, reporting automation, client communication. | 🟡 Medium |

### Company Size Sweet Spot

- **Revenue:** $2M–$50M annually
- **Employees:** 10–200
- **Key signal:** Large enough to have pain, small enough to lack in-house AI/IT talent
- Per GTIA 2025 data: ~65% of SMBs spend $25K–$1M on tech annually ([GTIA](https://gtia.org/blog/whats-up-with-your-customers-5-smb-tech-buying-trends))

### Pain Points AI Agents Solve

1. **Staff overwhelm** — repetitive tasks consuming 40-60% of employee time
2. **Customer response lag** — can't afford 24/7 support staff
3. **Data scattered across tools** — no unified workflow, manual copy-paste between systems
4. **Scaling bottleneck** — can't grow revenue without proportionally growing headcount
5. **Lack of AI expertise** — 62% of non-adopters cite "lack of understanding" as top barrier; 60% cite "lack of in-house resources" ([Service Direct 2025 Survey](https://servicedirect.com/resources/small-business-ai-report/))

### Budget Range

| Engagement Type | Price Range |
|---|---|
| Initial strategy/audit | $5K–$15K |
| AI agent deployment (project) | $15K–$60K |
| Monthly managed service retainer | $2K–$10K/month |
| Freelance AI consultant day rate | $600–$1,200/day |
| Boutique firm day rate | $1,200–$2,000/day |

**Hiyaku pricing recommendation:** Position at $3K–$8K/month managed retainer (accessible for $2M+ SMBs) with $5K–$15K setup fee. This undercuts boutique agencies ($10K–$30K/mo) while signaling quality above DIY tools ($50–$100/mo).

### Decision Makers

- **Primary:** CEO/Founder, COO, VP of Operations (companies <50 employees: almost always the owner)
- **Secondary:** Office Manager, Head of IT (if they have one), Director of Marketing
- **Influencers:** External IT consultants, MSPs, accountants/bookkeepers who advise on tech

### Technology Maturity Level

- Already using cloud tools (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, CRMs like HubSpot/Salesforce)
- May have experimented with ChatGPT or Zapier but hit a ceiling
- **NOT** ready to build their own — they want turnkey, managed solutions
- 77% of small businesses already use AI daily but mostly basic tools ([Service Direct](https://servicedirect.com/resources/small-business-ai-report/))

### Specific Use Cases They're Seeking

1. **AI receptionist / intake agent** (legal, healthcare, real estate)
2. **Customer support agent** (e-commerce, SaaS)
3. **Document processing & extraction** (legal, finance, insurance)
4. **Lead qualification & follow-up** (real estate, professional services)
5. **Internal knowledge base / Q&A agent** (all verticals)
6. **Scheduling & coordination** (healthcare, professional services)
7. **Reporting & analytics automation** (finance, e-commerce)

## 2. Market Research

### Market Size

- **Global AI agents market:** $7.6B in 2025 → projected ~$11–15B in 2026 (46% CAGR per [MarketsandMarkets](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/ai-agents-market-15761548.html))
- **Broader AI market:** $716B by 2029 ([GlobeNewsWire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/29/3228484/28124/en/))
- **SMB slice:** SMBs represent ~40% of total AI adoption market. Conservative estimate: **$3–6B addressable market for SMB AI agent services in 2026**
- **McKinsey estimates** $200B in new enterprise spending on agentic AI services alone ([McKinsey Dec 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/reimagining-the-value-proposition-of-tech-services-for-agentic-ai))
- 78% of growing SMBs plan to increase AI spending ([Salesforce 2025](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/smbs-ai-trends-2025/))

### Competitor Landscape

#### DIY Platforms (low-touch, self-serve)
| Company | Pricing | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Lindy.ai** | $49.99/mo+ | No-code agent builder, 4000+ integrations, HIPAA/SOC2 |
| **Relevance AI** | $29/mo+ | Low-code, data-driven agents |
| **Zapier AI** | $29.99/mo+ | Simple automations, still in beta for agents |
| **Make.com** | $10.59/mo+ | Visual workflow builder with AI steps |
| **Botpress** | $89/mo+ | Conversational AI focus |

#### Managed/Consulting (direct competitors to Hiyaku)
| Company | Focus | Price Range |
|---|---|---|
| **Vstorm** | Boutique agentic AI consulting for SMBs | Custom project pricing |
| **Six Paths Consulting** | AI strategy + Blue Ocean Strategy | Enterprise-leaning |
| **Leanware** | Applied AI for mid-market | Project-based |
| **Opinosis Analytics** | NLP/text analytics consulting | Niche |
| **Various freelancers on Upwork/Toptal** | Hourly AI consulting | $100–$300/hr |

#### Big Players (too expensive for SMBs, but brand-recognized)
- Accenture, Deloitte, McKinsey, BCG (AI practices)
- ServiceNow, UiPath (platform + services)

### The Gap (Hiyaku's Opportunity)

**What exists:** DIY tools ($30–$100/mo) that require technical know-how, OR enterprise consultancies ($150K+ projects).

**What's missing:** A **managed, turnkey AI agent service** for SMBs that:
- Handles everything end-to-end (strategy → deployment → ongoing management)
- Prices accessibly ($3K–$8K/mo range)
- Understands specific vertical workflows (not generic)
- Provides security/compliance (HIPAA, SOC2) without enterprise overhead
- Delivers in weeks, not months

This is the **"mid-market gap"** that Vstorm's research identified — 80% of AI initiatives stall before production ([RAND](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2680-1.html)). SMBs need a partner who gets them across the finish line.

## 3. Outreach Strategy

### Best Channels to Find Target Companies

| Channel | Approach | Expected Yield |
|---|---|---|
| **LinkedIn (organic + outreach)** | Target CEOs/COOs at 10-200 person companies in target verticals. Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator filters. | Highest ROI for B2B |
| **Industry-specific forums** | Legal: Lawyerist, Above the Law forums. Healthcare: practice management groups. Real estate: BiggerPockets. | Trust-building |
| **Local business groups** | Chamber of Commerce, BNI groups, Rotary, local tech meetups | Relationship-based |
| **Reddit** | r/smallbusiness (800K+), r/AiForSmallBusiness, r/AI_Agents, r/startups | Content + comments (no selling) |
| **Referrals from MSPs/IT consultants** | Partner with 5-10 MSPs who serve your target verticals | Warm intros, highest close rate |
| **Cold email** | Multi-touch sequences to verified decision-maker emails | 2-5% reply rate if personalized |

### Cold Outreach Framework

**LinkedIn Connection Request (keep under 300 chars):**
> Hi [Name] — I help [vertical] firms like yours automate [specific task] with AI agents. Saw you're growing the team at [Company]. Would love to share how one [similar company] cut [X task] time by 70%. Open to a quick chat?

**Follow-up Message (after connect):**
> Thanks for connecting! Quick question — how are you currently handling [pain point, e.g., "client intake" or "customer support after hours"]? We've been deploying AI agents for [vertical] companies that handle this 24/7. Happy to show you a 5-min demo — no commitment. Would [day] work?

**Cold Email Template:**
> Subject: [Company] + AI agents = [specific outcome]
>
> Hi [Name],
>
> I noticed [Company] is [growing / hiring / expanding into X]. Companies your size in [vertical] are using AI agents to [specific use case — e.g., "handle 80% of inbound client inquiries automatically"].
>
> We deploy and manage these agents end-to-end — no technical work on your side. One recent client ([similar company type]) reduced their [metric] by [X%] in the first month.
>
> Worth a 15-minute call to see if this fits? I have [day/time] open.
>
> — [Name], Hiyaku AI

**Key principles:**
- Lead with their pain, not your product
- Be specific to their vertical
- Offer a concrete outcome/metric
- Keep it under 100 words
- Multi-channel: LinkedIn + email + follow-up

### Partnership Opportunities

| Partner Type | Value Proposition | How to Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **MSPs (Managed Service Providers)** | They already have SMB client relationships + IT trust. Offer white-label or referral commissions (15-20%). | Attend SMB TechFest, join MSP communities, direct outreach to local MSPs |
| **IT Consultants / VARs** | Similar to MSPs but smaller. Often looking for AI to add to their offering. | LinkedIn outreach, local tech meetups |
| **Accountants / Bookkeepers** | Trusted advisors to SMB owners. They see the pain firsthand. | Offer referral fee ($500-$1K per closed deal) |
| **Industry-specific software vendors** | CRM, EHR, practice management vendors who want AI add-ons. | Integration partnerships, co-marketing |
| **Marketing agencies** | They serve SMBs and can bundle AI services. | Revenue share or referral model |

### Content Marketing Angles

1. **"AI Agents for [Vertical]" guides** — e.g., "How Law Firms Are Using AI Agents to Handle Client Intake 24/7"
2. **ROI calculators** — "How Much Time Could Your [Vertical] Save with AI Agents?"
3. **Case studies** (even anonymized early on) — concrete metrics
4. **"AI vs. Hiring" comparison pieces** — cost of an AI agent vs. another FTE
5. **Security/compliance content** — "HIPAA-Compliant AI: What Healthcare Practices Need to Know"
6. **Video demos** — short Loom-style walkthroughs of agents in action

### Referral Strategy

- **Offer $500–$1,000 referral bonus** for any introduction that becomes a paying client
- Create a simple referral landing page on hiyaku.ai
- Ask every happy client for 2-3 referrals during onboarding
- Partner with complementary consultants (marketing, IT, accounting) for cross-referrals

## 4. SEO Strategy for hiyaku.ai

### Target Keywords (by intent)

#### High-Intent (Bottom-Funnel) — Prioritize These
- "AI agents for small business"
- "managed AI services for SMB"
- "AI automation consulting"
- "AI agent deployment service"
- "hire AI consultant for small business"
- "AI chatbot for [law firm / dental practice / real estate]"
- "AI customer support for small business"

#### Mid-Funnel (Research Phase)
- "best AI tools for small business 2026"
- "AI agents vs hiring employees"
- "how to automate [client intake / customer support / scheduling] with AI"
- "AI for [legal / healthcare / real estate] firms"
- "cost of AI consulting for small business"

#### Long-Tail / Vertical-Specific (Lower Competition)
- "AI receptionist for law firm"
- "HIPAA compliant AI agent healthcare"
- "AI lead qualification real estate"
- "automated client intake legal"
- "AI document processing small business"
- "AI phone answering service for small business"

### Content Topics for Blog/Landing Pages

- hiyaku.ai/ai-agents-legal
- hiyaku.ai/ai-agents-healthcare
- hiyaku.ai/ai-agents-real-estate
- hiyaku.ai/ai-agents-ecommerce
- hiyaku.ai/ai-agents-finance

**Blog Posts (publish 2-4/month):**
1. "The SMB Owner's Guide to AI Agents in 2026"
2. "5 AI Agents Every Law Firm Should Deploy Today"
3. "AI Agent vs. Virtual Assistant: What's the Difference?"
4. "How Much Does an AI Agent Cost? Pricing Guide for Small Business"

7. "From ChatGPT to AI Agents: What Changed and Why It Matters for Your Business"
8. "Case Study: How [Company Type] Saved 30 Hours/Week with AI Agents"

### Local vs National SEO

- **Start national** — managed AI services is a remote-first offering
- **Add local pages** if Hiyaku operates in specific metros (e.g., "AI consulting [city]")
- Google Business Profile: set up if doing any local work
- Claim hiyaku.ai on directories: Clutch, The Manifest, G2, Capterra

### Competitor SEO Signals

- **Lindy.ai** ranks for "AI agents for small business," "best AI agents," "no-code AI agent"
- **Vstorm.co** ranks for "AI consulting for SMBs," "agentic AI consulting"
- **Gap opportunity:** Nobody strongly owns "managed AI agent service" or vertical-specific terms like "AI agents for law firms." These are wide open.
