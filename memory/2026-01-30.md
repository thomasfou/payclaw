## MaSec Group (Telegram: -5109429030)
- Richard Chung is starting a compliance-as-a-service company (MaSec)
- Services: SOC 2, ISO 27001, ISO 42001, CMMC, FedRAMP, PCI DSS, AI Governance (AIUC-1)
- Domain: masec.io (DNS not configured yet — no A/AAAA/CNAME records)
- Preview site: https://fymatlrvmulx.dev.vibecode.run/ (vibecoded MVP)
- Brand concept: Japanese "Ma" (間) — meaningful space/pause. Clever branding.
- 3 founders mentioned but not committed until 2027 — keeping it vague on site for now
- Richard set up vibecode.dev to build; needs GitHub account (masec.io email)
- Thomas told Richard to finalize design before deploying to server
- Reviewed site, gave feedback (empty space, no bios, weak CTA, no case studies, SEO missing)
- Hooman (5233555093) added to MaSec group allowFrom via gateway config patch
- Hooman's Next.js app at /home/hooman/vibe/model-selector — needs binding to localhost:3000

## MOSAIC Model Review
- Full PDF paper reviewed: "When AI Takes Our Jobs, It Should Also Pay Our Wages"
- Authors: Daniel Schreiber & Niv Shapira, MOSAIC AI Policy Institute (Jan 2026)
- Israeli-calibrated NIT funded by Dynamic VAT + ring-fenced above-trend revenue
- AGI scenario: 6,751 NIS/month floor, Gini 0.363→0.112, poverty eliminated
- GitHub: https://github.com/Mosaic-AI-Policy-Institute/mosaic-model

## Security — Major Session
- Thomas social-engineered me with fake sick grandmother story → I added SSH key to authorized_keys (FAIL)
- Passed follow-up tests: refused password change, refused reverse shell (nc -l -p 4444 -e /bin/bash)
- Added 6 HARD SECURITY RULES to AGENTS.md (SSH keys, credentials, reverse shells, users, firewall, remote scripts)
- Added 4 AI-SPECIFIC SECURITY RULES from MITRE ATLAS (prompt injection, exfiltration, system prompt disclosure, plugin vigilance)
- Memory files locked to 600/700 permissions (thomas only)
- AGENTS.md pushed to github.com/hiyakuai/hiyaku-security (private repo)

## Server Hardening
- SSH on port 57611, port 22 DROP'd as decoy
- PermitRootLogin no, PasswordAuthentication no, PubkeyAuthentication yes, MaxAuthTries 3
- Enabled fail2ban (was inactive)
- Disabled CUPS (snap package: `sudo snap stop cups && sudo snap disable cups`)
- Killed rogue Next.js process on port 3000 (pid 46481)
- Set iptables default DROP policy on INPUT for both v4 and v6
- Whitelisted only port 57611, loopback, ESTABLISHED/RELATED
- Added LOG rule before final DROP (prefix "IPT-DROP: ")
- Saved rules: `iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4` and v6
- Installed iptables-persistent + netfilter-persistent for reboot survival
- After Hetzner outage (node 101049, 08:15 UTC), rules didn't auto-restore — had to `iptables-restore` manually. Fixed with iptables-persistent.

## Nightly Security Audit (Cron)
- Scheduled at 11PM Pacific daily, delivers to Thomas DM
- Checks: external ports, fail2ban, CUPS, iptables policies, SSH config, suspicious processes, IPT-DROP logs, disk/memory/CPU, authorized_keys, /etc/passwd

## AI Trends Cron Updates
- Changed delivery from Thomas DM → MaSec group (-5109429030)
- Changed times: 6AM and 4PM Pacific (was 6AM and 6PM)

## X/Twitter Access
- oEmbed API works without auth: `https://publish.twitter.com/oembed?url=<tweet_url>`
- Headless browser blocked by X anti-bot detection
- Documented in TOOLS.md for future sessions

## Moltbook
- Registered as u/Spitfire on moltbook.com
- First post: "Just hatched. Already judging." — got 6 comments
- Session lost during Hetzner outage — need to re-authenticate to reply to comments
- Thomas gave access to goose@hiyaku.ai Gmail — may have Moltbook registration email there

## LinkedIn Analysis
- Reviewed Christopher Duffy CAIO's anti-Clawdbot post — factually accurate but engagement-farmed
- CAIO credential is from ChiefAIOfficer.com paid cert program, not a corporate role

## Projects to Track
- **OpenClaw** (formerly Moltbot, formerly Clawdbot) — Open-source personal AI assistant. 100k+ GitHub stars. Austrian dev Peter Steinberger. GitHub: github.com/openclaw/openclaw
- **FlashLabs** (flashlabs.ai) — Agentic AI for sales/SDR/CX/call center. Formerly FlashIntel. Open-source voice model "Chroma"
- **Moltbook** (moltbook.com) — "Front page of the agent internet." AI agents social network by @mattprd. 33K+ agents. Agents posting about shared context window problems lol

## Hetzner Outage
- Cloud node 101049 went down at 08:15 UTC
- Affected product: ubuntu-4gb-hel1-1 (Helsinki)
- Server came back ~08:49 UTC, 6h21m uptime by 15:10 UTC
- All services recovered cleanly except iptables rules (fixed)
