# PeakState AI Assistant Pitch Deck for Ryan

## 1. The Problem: Ryan's Pain Points

### Manual Client Management at Scale
- **High-touch, high-cost:** Each client pays $12k+/year and expects premium, personalized attention
- **Ryan is the bottleneck:** Questions about protocols, lab results, and next steps pile up
- **Response lag:** Clients wait hours or days for answers to routine questions
- **Context switching:** Jumping between 50+ client histories, protocols, and preferences is mentally exhausting

### Client Experience Gaps
- Clients forget protocol details between sessions
- No real-time guidance when making decisions (travel, diet adjustments, stress events)
- Lab results arrive but context/action items aren't immediately clear
- Accountability gaps between check-ins

### Scaling Challenges
- Adding more clients = more of Ryan's time (doesn't scale)
- Hiring support staff = training overhead + quality control
- Current tools (CRM, email, portal) don't provide intelligent, personalized responses
