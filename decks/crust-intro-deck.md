# What is an AI Personal Assistant?

### Think: A digital employee that never sleeps

An AI assistant that:
- **Lives on your devices** — not just in a chat window
- **Takes real actions** — sends emails, updates calendars, manages files
- **Learns your preferences** — persistent memory across conversations
- **Works 24/7** — handles tasks while you sleep
- **Integrates everywhere** — messaging, email, calendar, web, and more

# Why Now? What Changed?

### 2024-2025: AI could *talk*
- ChatGPT, Claude — great for Q&A
- Required you to copy/paste results manually
- No persistent memory between sessions

### 2026: AI can *do*
- Autonomous agents that execute multi-step tasks
- Persistent memory — remembers context over weeks/months
- Connected to your real systems (calendar, email, files)
- Proactive — alerts you, follows up, takes action
